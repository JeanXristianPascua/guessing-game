# GuessingGame

## Project Overview

The **GuessingGame** is a simple, browser-based game where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback for each guess, indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or invalid. The game continues until the user successfully guesses the correct number or decides to quit.

## Key Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Each game session generates a new number within a defined range.
- **Feedback System**: Users receive immediate feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or invalid.
- **Interactive Play**: The game continues until the correct guess is made or the user quits.

## Technology Used

- **HTML**: Structures the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic and user interaction.
